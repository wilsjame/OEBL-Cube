HoloLens Mixed Reality Unity Project for the Occupational Ergonomics and Biomechanics Research Laboratory.

The application's Unity project files are contained here.

## Installation and Deployment
 Microsoft's Mixed Reality Documentation: 
* [Unity development overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/unity-development-overview "Mixed Reality Documentation")
* [Using Visual Studio to deploy and debug](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-visual-studio "Mixed Reality Documentation")

I've tried maintaining updated versions of each software but kept running into errors. For now, I've found these versions to work together without any trouble. 

* Unity 2017.1.2f1 (64-bit)
* Visual Studio 2017 Community
